# Biochemical-ALNN
This project contains an implementation of the adaptive linear neural network using CRNs in Matlab code. There are three files, main_program, main_function and function_in_ODE45. The main process of forward propagation and weight update is included in the main program. As the data set could be generated following a standard normal distribution, we don't offer the data denoted by the variable 'rand_x'in the code. The two main functions in the main_function file, 'NNFeedforward' and 'hybrid_parameter_update', correspond to the fCRN and olCRN in the text, respectively. As our CRNs are endowed with mass action kinetics, we utilize the ODEsolver ode45 in Matlab to obtain the solution to the equations of the fCRN system and the olCRN system. Thus, there are four functions used in ode45 in the third file.
